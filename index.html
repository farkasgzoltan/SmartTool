<p>SmartTool is a very compact NFC enabled microcontroller board with a 2 module wall socket form factor specifically. The addition of optional WiFi or BT modules makes the board ideal for home automation and IoT applications.</p>

<p>The board has been originally designed by ipTronix and financed by Arrow and NXP with the intent of spreading use of NFC technology and for this purpose a range of "production ready" applications have been developed to allow people to quickly get to a working prototype.</p>

<p>The software is based on FreeRTOS kernel and an embedded port of LibNFC and LibFreefare which provide a solid infrastructure for standards based communication with tags and cell phones.
Demo applications include card emulation, card reader, vending machine, authentication, data exchange with cell phone (with card emulation)</p>

<p>The project is completely open source and although was initially released only to customers buying the board, now it has been publicly released in full on github.</p>
